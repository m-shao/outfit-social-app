## Elevator pitch
Say goodbye to the stress of figuring out what to wear based on the forecast! With Outfit Social App, you can get personalized outfit recommendations tailored to the weather conditions in your area.

## Inspiration

We wanted to create an app that would make it easier for people to choose what to wear for the weather, so they can save their brain power for more important things. We were inspired by the story of Albert Einstein, who bought several variations of the same suit so that he wouldn't have to waste time deciding what to wear each morning.

## What it does

Outfit Social is an app that suggests outfits based on the weather in your area, so you can be both comfortable and stylish without having to put in a lot of effort. The app uses logical algorithms to provide personalized recommendations, taking into account factors such as your style preferences and body type. You can also share photos of your outfits, discover new styles, and connect with other users who share your fashion interests.

## How we built it

We built Outfit Smart using a combination of React, Express, Firebase, and Auth0. We also integrated the OpenMeteo API to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information. For the design, we used TailwindCSS to create a modern and responsive user interface.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was creating accurate and personalized outfit recommendations that would meet the needs of different users. We also had to ensure that the app was secure and user-friendly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of the algorithms we developed to provide personalized outfit suggestions, as well as the user interface we created using TailwindCSS. We're also happy with the integration of the OpenMeteo API, which provides accurate and reliable weather information.

## What we learned

Through building Outfit Smart, we learned a lot about sorting algorithms and how they can be used to improve the user experience. We also gained experience with React, Express, Firebase, and Auth0, which will be valuable for future projects.

## What's next for Outfit Social App

In the future, we plan to add more features to the app, such as creating virtual wardrobes and connecting with other users for fashion advice. We also want to continue refining the algorithms to provide even more accurate and personalized outfit recommendations. Ultimately, our goal is to make it easier for people to make smart outfit choices and free up their brain power for more important things.
